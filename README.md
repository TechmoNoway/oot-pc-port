# OOT PC Port

An independent project exploring a native Windows x86-64 port of Ocarina of Time for Switch 2.

## Status

Early development. The Windows host scaffold builds successfully and passes its memory and performance-counter self-test.

The game is not playable yet. ARM64 translation, game loading, operating-system services, and graphics are planned.

## Development direction

The next milestones are input inspection, ARM64 translation, module loading, operating-system services, and graphics. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

Game containers, keys, extracted files, generated game code, saves, shader caches, and compiled executables stay outside version control. Build output belongs under `build/`; future generated output belongs under `generated/`.
